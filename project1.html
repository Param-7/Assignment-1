        <p>My Favorite team is Real Madrid Real Madrid is my favorite club because they have a long history of 
            winning and playing great football. They always try their best to win, and that's something I admire.
            Their stadium, the Santiago Bernabeu, is famous, and their white kit is iconic. I also feel a connection 
            to Real Madrid because they have fans all over the world, and it's great to be part of such a big community.
            Supporting Real Madrid makes me happy and proud, and it's something I love to do. They're not just a 
            football club to me; they're like a family. Real Madrid has their own song as well, Which is in spanish 
            and was sing by their all the players.

        <h2>Playing Style</h2>
        <div id="vini"><img src="/Pictures/vini.jpg" alt="Picture of Vinicius Junior" height="200em"></div>
        <p>Playing as a left-winger is exciting because I get to be both creative and defensive on the field.
           Watching players like Vinicius Junior has taught me a lot about this position. He's really good at 
           dribbling past defenders and making accurate passes and shots. I've learned that confidence and bravery 
           are key when playing as a left-winger. Vinicius never hesitates to take on opponents, and I try to do the 
           same. By watching him closely, I've picked up on how to position myself better and anticipate what's going
            to happen in the game. Studying Vinicius's moves in videos has become a big part of how I learn. I watch how 
            he plays, how he moves, and try to do similar things in my own games. I want to be as effective as he is and
            help my team win. In the end, being a left-winger isn't just about doing cool movesâ€”it's about being smart and always trying to improve.

        <h2>Watching Football</h2>
        <p>
            Football is my passion. Whether I'm watching games or playing with friends,
            it's where I find joy and excitement. I love the simplicity and universality of the game.
            It's not just about winning; it's about the shared moments with fellow fans and the lessons 
            it teaches about teamwork and resilience. There are also another things you can do like play
            FPL. Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is a blast! It turns fans into managers, adding strategy and 
            competition to the football season. You pick players, compete against friends, and join a global
            community of football enthusiasts. FPL celebrates the love of the game, making every matchday 
            exciting and unforgettable.
